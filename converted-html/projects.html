					<iframe width="789" height="400" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/U1GzJsdVMyk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>Project Wadi Attir is a groundbreaking initiative of a Bedouin community in the Negev desert, demonstrating an approach to sustainable desert agriculture, replicable locally as well as in other arid regions around the world. Using The Lab's sustainability principles as a guide, the project is designed to leverage Bedouin traditional values, know-how and experience with modern-day science and cutting edge technologies.</p>

								<li>
									<blockquote>"Project Wadi Attir is creating a new reality of empowerment and hope for the future, encouraging a move to self-reliance. In particular, the project creates an unprecedented new situation whereby women are equal partners in leading a significant development process with men. Involvement in the project will open new horizons and new opportunities for women and strengthen their ability to influence the fabric of family and community."<cite><img src="assets/img/amal.jpg">Amal Elsana-Alh'jooj<br>Director, AJEEC-NISPED</cite></blockquote>

The project will also sell cosmetic creams and soaps, infusion teas and essential oils. These products are based on Bedouin traditional medicine, and created from medicinal plants and herbs grown onsite.</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<blockquote>"This project offers a golden opportunity for people in the Bedouin community to organize in an independent, democratic fashion, with emphasis on common goals, shared effort and commitment to community values. With this project we broke the mythos that 'these people' are not able to manage themselves, that they always need someone else to tell them what to do. In all my years in community work, I have never come cross a change making project like Project Wadi Attir."<cite><img src="assets/img/team/mariam.jpg">Mariam Abu Rakayek<br>Founding Member of the Project Team</cite></blockquote>

					<h3>The Sustainability Prize at EARTH University</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">Incorporating The Lab's "Five Core Principles of Sustainability" into real life practice.</h4>
					<p>The Sustainability Prize, established in 2009 in collaboration with faculty members from EARTH University in Costa Rica, is awarded to the Graduation Project (GP) that best incorporates The Lab's "Five Core Principles of Sustainability." The student with the winning GP is awarded a $10,000 prize for implementation of the project, with $1,000 returning to high school he or she attended.</p>

								<p>The Lab is being developed as a network linking advanced research centers mapped onto specific eco-zones around the world. The centers will subscribe to a common set of principles, values and operating practices. Each center will aim to pioneer strategies, technologies and best practices that will be applicable in similar eco-zones around the world. Individual centers representing specific eco-zones will also work collaboratively with one another.</p>
								<!--<p>The first eco-zone-related node in The Lab's network of activities, The Dryland Sustainability Initiative, has been recently established in collaboration with the Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research of The Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, at their Sede Boker campus in the Negev desert. The purpose is "to advance research, experimentation and field testing of means, methods, practices and technologies for achieving sustainability in dryland regions." The Dryland Sustainability Initiative uses the site at Project Wadi Attir as a base for fieldwork.</p>
								<p>A similar joint initiative has been established with EARTH University in Costa Rica for Sustainability in the Humid and Dry Tropics.</p>
								<p>In the last few years, Dr. Ben-Eli has been scouting locations for the next centers. He has taken reconnaissance trips to both Bhutan and the Galapagos (for Alpine and Island Sustainability Centers, respectively), establishing significant relationships with officials and other local change-agents, and brainstorming possible avenues of engagement.</p>-->
