					<!--<p class="intro">In recent decades, driven largely by the impact of human activities, serious threats have emerged to the integrity of whole ecosystems, to other forms of life, and to the future well being of humanity itself. Change has now become an urgent necessity, but the challenge is unprecedented in scope - there is no tried-and-true operating manual to guide us.</p>

					<p>The Sustainability Laboratory was established in 2008 by Dr. Michael Ben-Eli in order to help address the most pressing sustainability issues facing the planet. Founded on the belief that effective responses will not likely emerge from the same methods, structures and mechanisms that produced the existing crisis, The Lab is being organized to foster bold experimentation with untested ideas, approaches and technologies, aiming to challenge the prevailing models that result in preservation of the status quo.</p>
					<p>To guide its activities, The Lab has developed its own unique, action-oriented <a href="../approach.html">conceptual framework</a>. Inspired by the work of innovative thinkers such as Buckminster Fuller and Stafford Beer, and synthesized by Dr. Ben-Eli, The Lab's signature approach is rooted in a system-oriented design strategy, integrating a rigorous definition of sustainability and a derived set of core principles. We favor approaches that take a global perspective, and feature cross-sector and cross-disciplinary collaboration.</p>

					<p>Applying this holistic framework, The Lab engages in research, development, and education activities focused around key sustainability-related issues. Our growing portfolio of projects demonstrate cutting edge, model approaches to sustainability challenges, applicable on a local, regional, and planetary scale. This is best exemplified by the progress of The Lab's flagship project, <a href="../projects.html">Project Wadi Attir</a>, a Bedouin-led sustainable development project in the Negev desert.</p>-->

					<h3>Why A Lab</h3>
					<p>Addressing the sustainability challenge requires going beyond mere adjustments in existing patterns of doing things to fundamentally changing the way we manage human affairs.</p>
					<p><img class="article-img-left" src="assets/img/LabTech.JPG">The unprecedented nature of the required change means that there is no tried-and-true operating manual to guide us. The capacity for thinking in new paradigms and pursuing creative experimentation is, therefore, essential. Hence the concept of a laboratory, with connotations of exploration, radical innovation, going beyond the familiar, and breaking new ground.</p>
					<p>Just as the great defense laboratories assembled extraordinary talent to develop destructive technologies, The Sustainability Laboratory will harness worldwide talent to advance a planetary sustainability agenda, helping humanity secure the promise of its next evolutionary step.</p>

					<h3>Mission</h3>
					<p class="intro"><em>"To act as a catalyst for accelerating transition of world society and its economy to a sustainable basis by researching, developing, and demonstrating breakthrough sustainability practices, thereby expanding prospects and producing positive, life-affirming impacts on people and ecosystems in all parts of the world."</em></p>
				</article>
				<article class="scroll-target clearfix" id="areas">
					<h3>Areas of Activity</h3>
					<p class="intro">The Labâ€™s work will focus on four interrelated areas of activity that are essential for catalyzing deep change: Development Projects, Technology Innovations, Green Economics, and Education.</p>

							<ul class="overview">
								<li>
									<p><strong>Development Projects:</strong> While most sustainability-related projects today tend to be sector or issue specific, development projects are comprehensive and multifaceted by nature. The ability to employ a holistic, system-based approach to development is critical for ensuring lasting, positive effects.</p>
									<p><em>The Lab will conceive, design and implement groundbreaking, model development projects that integrate all the interdependent dimensions of sustainability in a holistic, practical and impactful way.</em></p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Technology Innovations:</strong> As has been the case throughout history, technological innovations will continue to underlie the evolution of society. Low-technology approaches have an important role to play, particularly in less developed areas of the world and in the short to medium term. Ultimately, however, it will be radical advances in science and disruptive new technologies which will play a vital role in driving change.</p>
									<p><em>The Lab will create and stimulate development of cutting edge sustainability-enhancing technologies, and facilitate the prototyping of integrated green technology applications on the ground.</em></p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Green Economics:</strong> Economic activity which ignores true costs continues to drive markets in directions that produce multiple adverse impacts. Introducing new models and new financial instruments in order to reorient economic activity is fundamental to ensuring appropriate change.</p>
									<p><em>The Lab will research, develop and experiment with new financial instruments that incorporate true cost calculations and account for externalities. It will assist in tailoring financial strategies for the realization of specific sustainable development goals.</em></p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Education:</strong> In order for change to occur, the new paradigm must become a part of people's innermost consciousness. Broad-based sustainability literacy is an essential component of the necessary shift.</p>
									<p><em>The Lab will engage in a variety of educational activities including the creation of training programs for leaders in business and government, the development of special programs for students at all levels, and the dissemination of sustainability-related materials for the general public.</em></p>
								</li>
							</ul>

					<p>These four main areas of activity will be designed to reinforce one another, thus amplifying the cumulative impacts of Lab initiatives.</p>
