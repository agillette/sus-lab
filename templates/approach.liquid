					<p class="intro">To guide its activities, The Lab has developed its own unique, action-oriented conceptual framework. Synthesized by Dr. Michael Ben-Eli, this framework and its key components have been refined and applied in conjunction with numerous consulting and project development initiatives of all kinds and in many parts of the world.</p>

					<h3>A Rigorous Definition of Sustainability</h3>
					<p>The term "sustainability," a relatively recent addition to our lexicon, has been widely and indiscriminately used to the point of trivialization. 
					<p>We hold that the ultimate objective of establishing the concept of sustainability as an organizing principle is to foster a well-functioning alignment between individuals, society, the economy and the regenerative capacity of the planet's life-supporting ecosystems. This alignment represents a particular type of balance in the interaction between a population and the carrying capacity of its environment. It is this specific balance that must be the focus of a meaningful, operational definition of sustainability.</p>
					<img src="assets/img/graph.png">
					<p>The Lab defines the term "sustainability" as follows: <blockquote>"A dynamic equilibrium in the process of interaction between a population and the carrying capacity of its environment such that the population develops to express its full potential without producing irreversible, adverse effects on the carrying capacity of the environment upon which it depends."</blockquote></p>
					<p>This equilibrium has been greatly disturbed in our time, making the current trajectory of human affairs unsustainable.</p>
