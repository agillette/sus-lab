					<h3>The Five Core Principles of Sustainability</h3>
					<p class="intro">An essential road map to developing model sustainability practices.</p>
					<p>The Five Core Principles are derived from The Lab's definition of sustainability; the five domains represent key dimensions of the underlying interaction.</p>

						<h3>The Material Domain</h3>
						<img src="assets/img/5cp-1.png" width="15%">
						<p class="intro">Contain entropy and ensure that the flow of resources, through and within the economy, is as nearly non-declining as is permitted by physical laws.</p>
						<p>Examples of Policy and Operational Implications:
							<ul class="fa-ul">
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Strive for highest resource productivity</li> 
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Amplify performance with each cycle of use</li> 
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Continuously recycle non-regenerative resources</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Affect an unbroken, closed-loop flow of matter and energy in a planetary infrastructure conceived as a whole</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Control leakages and avoid stagnation, misplaced concentrations or random diffusion of chemical elements during cycles of use</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>The Economic Domain</h3>
						<img src="assets/img/5cp-2.png" width="15%">
						<p class="intro">To guide the economy, adopt an appropriate accounting system, fully aligned with the planet's ecological processes and reflecting true, comprehensive biospheric pricing.</p>
						<p>Examples of Policy and Operational Implications:
							<ul class="fa-ul">
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Employ a comprehensive concept of wealth related to the simultaneous enhancement of five key forms of capital: Natural, Human, Social, Manufactured and Financial</li> 
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Align the world's economy with nature's regeneration capacity and incorporate critical externalities in all cost and benefit accounts</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Embody a measure of well-being and human development in economic calculations</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Design regulation and taxation policies to accentuate desirable and eliminate adverse outcomes, optimizing the whole</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Rely on market mechanisms, calibrated to reflect "true" costs, for allocation of capital assets</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>The Domain of Life</h3>
						<img src="assets/img/5cp-3.png" width="15%">
						<p class="intro">Ensure that the essential diversity of all forms of life in the biosphere is maintained.</p>
						<p>Examples of Policy and Operational Implications:
							<ul class="fa-ul">
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Assume a responsible stewardship for our planet's web of biological diversity</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Ensure that the essential diversity of all forms of life in the biosphere is maintained</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Harvest species only to regeneration capacity</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Conserve the variety of the existing gene pool</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Shape land use patterns to reduce human encroachment on other forms of life and enhance biological diversity in areas of human habitat</li>

					<article class="scroll-target" id="social">
						<h3>The Social Domain</h3>
						<img src="assets/img/5cp-4.png" width="15%">
						<p class="intro">Maximize degrees of freedom and potential self-realization of all humans without any individual or group adversely affecting others.</p>
						<p>Examples of Policy and Operational Implications:
							<ul class="fa-ul">
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Foster tolerance as a cornerstone of social interactions</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Enshrine universal rights within a framework of planetary citizenship</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Provide for inclusion and effective democracy in governance</li> 
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Ensure equitable access to life nurturing resources</li>

						<h3>The Spiritual or Values Domain</h3>
						<img src="assets/img/5cp-5.png" width="15%">
						<p class="intro">Recognize the seamless, dynamic continuum of mystery, wisdom, love, energy and matter, that links the outer reaches of the cosmos with our solar system, our planet and its biosphere, including all humans, with our internal metabolic systems and their externalized extensions. Embody this recognition in a universal ethics for guiding human actions.</p>
						<p>As a guiding principle, the spiritual dimension does not carry the connotation of conventional religion. Rather, it evokes the integration of mind and heart in realization of the essential oneness at the center of being.</p>
						<p>By anchoring the essence of human motivation and intention, the spiritual principle acts as the causal root, which sets the tone for the whole. It drives the integration of the other four principles, those related to the material, economic, life, and social domains. If integrated in a balanced way, it can infuse a common purpose, provide a common foundation, and stimulate common resolve. Lacking the ethical commitment implied by the spiritual principle, considerations of questions related to the four other domains, no matter how elaborately expressed, are reduced to mere technicalities.</p>
