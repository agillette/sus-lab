By the mid-night application closing deadline, the program received applications from 20 countries, including: Australia, Canada, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Kenya, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the US.</p>\r\n<p>Quality of the application is such that evaluation and selection for the 20 spots we can offer was a tough process. All candidates were strong, and it was an honor to read about their unique backgrounds. We are looking forward to an amazing program and will continue to update everyone here on the GSF Blog. If you applied and did not get in, or missed the deadline, we urge you to try again next year and keep up with the GSF as we lead our first Summer of this new initiative.</p>\r\n<p>Fondly,<br>\r\nGSF Team</p>",
